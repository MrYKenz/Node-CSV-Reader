This is a Property Price Paid Statistical Data Set which Contains HM Land Registry data Â© Crown copyright and database right 2019. This data is licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.

:atom_symbol: This REST API is built using Node.js with Express using asynchronous streams to provide fast requests tested using Postman.
